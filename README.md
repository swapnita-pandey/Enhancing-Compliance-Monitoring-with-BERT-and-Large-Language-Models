# Enhancing Compliance Monitoring with BERT and Large Language Models

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape,

Ensuring compliance with security policies and standards is a paramount challenge for organizations. 

My project, focused on enhancing compliance monitoring through the integration of BERT and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Presents an innovative approach to automate and optimize the process of identifying non-compliant activities.

Through this endeavor, I have embarked on a journey to revolutionize how compliance breaches are detected and remediated.

My journey doesn't end here. I envision a compliance monitoring solution that empowers organizations to maintain security and adhere 
to standards seamlessly. 

By addressing challenges, enhancing accuracy, and embracing cutting-edge technology, I strive to deliver a comprehensive solution that 
safeguards sensitive information and fosters compliance excellence.

In conclusion, my project is a step toward the future of compliance monitoring, leveraging the intelligence of BERT and Large
Language Models. Together, let's embrace the power of automation, insight generation, and continuous improvement to strengthen 
compliance management in a dynamic digital era.
